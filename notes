- show score of a move in an effect like in a role playing game
- the deeper you go the faster
- get rid of ugly space in the bottom
- bonus for many lines
- optimize for mobile: portrait displayed poorly

- chocolate style, brown stones, coin = nut

- possibly extract Erase as its own Class
- more beautiful ui, arrange elements in index.html for easier styling
- the deeper the faster
- bomb fun but too powerful, maybe reduce radius

- maybe dig by one more line to show whole bomb radius
- fallings should not stick but fall to the ground
- need a field state (loose) that prevents overall sticking (for e.g. explosion)
- I falls into single fillable field within 2 soils, erases first field, but not the followings
- soil debris soil debris does not count as filled
- had an occasion where a line was all soil but one filled, and it didnt dissapear (bug)
- if frame was a debris, frames could be of various shapes

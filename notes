- anchor does not work when should search left than right again
- depth / colors!
- fallings should not stick but fall to the ground
- need surroundings / frame go up with the soil to create the illusion of digging

- I falls into single fillable field within 2 soils, erases first field, but not the followings
- soil debris soil debris does not count as filled
- soil anchors not always working, weird behaviour

- had an occasion where a line was all soil but one filled, and it didnt dissapear (bug)
- speed boost should not make soil come sooner.
- whenever there is less than 3 filled soil lines at should add another soil line

- if frame was a debris, frames could be of various shapes
- hanging stones fall (and do it together)
- falling stones stick on anchors
- need a field state (loose) that prevents overall sticking (for e.g. explosion)

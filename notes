- random golds in soil to pick up, the deeper, the more reward
- fallings should not stick but fall to the ground
- need a field state (loose) that prevents overall sticking (for e.g. explosion)
- I falls into single fillable field within 2 soils, erases first field, but not the followings
- soil debris soil debris does not count as filled
- had an occasion where a line was all soil but one filled, and it didnt dissapear (bug)
- if frame was a debris, frames could be of various shapes
